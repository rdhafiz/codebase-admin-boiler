                We'll give you lots of materials to use before you come to our training
                sessions, both online and in person. This includes videos, slideshows,
                and forms to help you practice. You'll also get to try some mock exams
                to get a feel for what it's really like, and you'll get feedback from
                our teachers to help you improve. Plus, we'll give you a study guide to
                help you learn on your own.
