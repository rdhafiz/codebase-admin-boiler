                                    Working as a nurse in the UK can be a rewarding experience, but it's
                                    important to go into it with realistic expectations. Before making the
                                    move, it's important to research and be prepared for the differences
                                    between the healthcare systems in the Philippines and the UK.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One expectation that may not match reality is the modernity of UK
                                    hospitals. While UK hospitals strive to provide the best care to
                                    patients, the buildings and equipment may not be as up-to-date as one
                                    would expect. Additionally, it's not uncommon for relatives not to stay
                                    with patients throughout their hospital stay and personal care is often
                                    not only carried out by HCAs but also by nurses.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Overtime pay is another aspect that may not match the expectation,
                                    Overtime pay is not mandatory in the UK and only applicable when agreed
                                    upon before starting the shift. As per NHS Employers, nurses and health
                                    care assistants in England are not eligible for overtime pay unless it
                                    is agreed upon in advance.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Lastly, the cost of living is also an important factor, UK cost of
                                    living is much higher than in the Philippines and budgeting accordingly
                                    is important. The cost of living in London may be higher than in Manila,
                                    but it also offers a wide range of amenities and opportunities that come
                                    with living in a bustling and diverse international city. With a higher
                                    cost of living, it's important to budget and plan accordingly, but it
                                    also means that London can offer a higher
                                    standard of living and access to a wider range of services and
                                    amenities.

                                    In conclusion, while there are opportunities for career development and
                                    overall a more comfortable life available in the UK as a nurse, it may
                                    not be exactly as one imagined. Understanding these differences and
                                    preparing for them in advance will help make the transition smoother.

                                    <p class="fs-lg">
                                        The UK uses a different type
                                        of plug than what is commonly used in the Philippines, so it's important
                                        to have a three-pin socket adapter on hand in order to charge your
                                        devices. Additionally, it's a good idea to bring a reliable power bank,
                                        so that you'll have a backup source of power in case you can't charge
                                        your devices right away.

                                    <strong>Medication and Health Preparedness:</strong>
                                    <p class="fs-lg">
                                        If you have a
                                        health condition, it's important to bring a supply of your medication
                                        with you. This is especially important if you're susceptible to asthma,
                                        as the high pollen count in the UK can trigger asthma reactions for
                                        Filipino nurses who are not used to it. Make sure to bring enough
                                        medication to last for at least a month, so you have enough time to set
                                        up an appointment with a GP and have your medication
                                        prescribed in the UK.

                                        a UK-compatible phone or a UK
                                        SIM card for your phone is also important, this will allow you to have a
                                        local number and make calls, send messages or have internet access as
                                        soon as you land. Having a local SIM card also makes it easier for you
                                        to communicate with your colleagues, make new friends and contact local
                                        services. Additionally, it is a good idea to research mobile phone
                                        providers and plans in advance, so you can
                                        choose
                                        the one that best suits your needs and budget.
